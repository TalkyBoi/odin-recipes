Hello Everyone of course this is my first real Odin project, I have been hitting the motivational wall with my ADHD, and I am trying to stick with it. I do Enjoy the HTMl Course so far and hope to continue growing my skill and build a good life for myself. 

I will be using all of thew HTML skills I have been practicing up until now to build my first project. 

By the end I will have my first website I believe!
